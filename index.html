      <p class="article__main-text">The beloved sitcom Parks & Recreation aired from 2009-2015. The show is a mockumentary that follows the antics of a group of public officials in the small town of Pawnee, Indiana, as they contend with the challenges of making their home a better place in ways both small and big. Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), her boss Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), and their staff stole the hearts of viewers everywhere with their quirky charm and doggedly optimistic approach to government, community, and life in general.</p>

The collection of truly talented and hilarious actors mixed with the improv-style approach to filming led to some interesting behind-the-scenes stories that make the show that much more enjoyable.
