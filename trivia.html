          <li>Ron Swanson's character is based on a real government official the directors met while researching the show.
          </li>
          <li>The character of Ron Swanson is a skilled woodcrafter. Nick Offerman, the actor who plays Swanson, is also skilled at woodworking in real life. He even runs his own woodworking business as a side job.
          </li>
          <li>Ron Swanson also has three brothers who aren't mentioned in any way on the show until Season 7 (Episode 8): Don, Lon, and Vaughn.

        <ul class="list_items">
          <li>Chris Pratt, the actor who plays Andy Dwyer, was so good at improv and physical comedy that the writers would often just write "Andy does something physical" in the script.
          </li>
          <li>In Season 1, Pratt actually flashed the whole cast when filming a scene where his character was suppose to appear naked. Pratt received a formal reprimand, but the shock on his cast members' faces was so real that the production team used the take in the episode.
          </li>
          <li>Although Parks & Rec is based in Indiana, the show never filmed there.

        <ul class="list_items">
          <li>The writers felt so bad about how Jim O'Hair's character, Jerry, is treated in the show that they felt compelled to compensate for it by giving Jerry a perfect home life.
          </li>
          <li>Adam Scott, the actor who plays Ben Wyatt, loved the show so much that he left a starring role in another show to join the cast at the end of Season 2. He went on to become Leslie Knope's main love interest throughout the series.
          </li>
          <li>Season 1 of the show was received so poorly by critics that most people involved assumed it would be canceled. Amy Poehler even stayed on as a cast member of Saturday Night Live for all of Season 1, commuting from New York to Los Angeles during filming, and only left the cast of SNL when Parks & Rec was renewed for a second season.
