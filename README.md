This is the MMC5277 Group 3 GitHub Repository: Matthew Kopay, Taylor Baumgardner, and Shannon Kuhn

Link to LIVE site: [MATT - copy/paste deployed link here]

Commit Discrepancy: [MATT - per the assignement instructions, we need to explain why you have significantly more commits on this project than Taylor and I do. It looks like you would submit multiple commits in one sitting for small and specific chunks of work, whereas Taylor and I would do broad work that changed multpile things and submit them all in one large commit. But I don't want to assume that's the case.]

Stumbling Blocks:

The only major stumbling block we ran into stemmed from a lack of experience in collaborative web project work and a lack of understanding of how pull requests would merge with the main branch in GitHub. At one point, the merged CSS was so jumbled that it broke the formatting of the site. We resolved this by dropping in a previous version of the CSS and reworking it until we were satisfied.
[MATT - insert any additional stumbling blocks you would like to note here]
