Commit Discrepancy: 
As the team lead, I would say that we all worked very hard and evenly on the project. 
Matt would submit multiple commits in one sitting for small and specific chunks of work, whereas Taylor and Shannon would do broad work that changed multiple things and submit them all in one large commit.

A lot of the commits were done on behalf of Shannon and Taylor at times because I was the assigned group leader.   -Matt

Stumbling Blocks:

The only major stumbling block we ran into stemmed from a lack of experience in collaborative web project work and a lack of understanding of how pull requests would merge with the main branch in GitHub. At one point, the merged CSS was so jumbled that it broke the formatting of the site. We resolved this by dropping in a previous version of the CSS and reworking it until we were satisfied.
Stumbling block for Matt was the animations on the casting page, took a while to get the sizing and proportions accurate enough.
